        The beautiful Law's Falls is set inside the Coonoor forest range with vast stretches of undisturbed nature around. Named after Col. Law, who constructed the new Coonoor ghat, this waterfall is formed by the Coonoor river. The height of the waterfall is about 30 feet through multiple cascades. This small & pretty waterfall attracts a huge crowd, especially during post-monsoons as part of Coonoor packages.
        
        Since this place is close to the main road, it does not need much walk/trek. One can enjoy the force of the water at bottom of the falls. The place is rocky and slippery.

        As the river flows down the mountains it forms two majestic waterfalls, the first one fifty five meters in height and the second one even higher at sixty one meters. To bask in the summer sun by the side of the lake or go boating in the lake are the favorite pastimes of people who visit there.`,

It is a romantic gem in the Queen of hill stations. This famous attraction does justice to its name and offers its visitors a breathtaking view of the graceful Catherine Falls.

        Located at a distance of just 12 km from Coonoor, the Dolphin’s Nose is a wonderful spot where one can enjoy the natural beauty at its best. The 1,550 m high altitude above sea level makes it a perfect getaway for all those who wish to overlook the 180-degree view of the surrounding scenery. If you look at the other side, you will get to see an unobstructed view of the Kotagiri streams, which is a dreamy experience for sightseeing lovers. It is undoubtedly a must-visit sightseeing place in Ooty.
        
        The excitement grows multi-fold if you enjoy a scenic drive through its winding narrow roads that allow you to discover the blue landscapes of Tamil Nadu as you ascend. The lush greenery makes couples and honeymooners forget everything about the daily chaos, and the excellent atmosphere and calmness of the quaint villages let families have a fun-filled time.

The whole area is cordoned off in high-rise compound walls and gates.

        The view point has an upper deck and a lower deck. One can have a lovely look of the hills and mountains, if you are lucky to have a clear day and the view was beautiful. Kotagiri itself is a lovely and unspoilt landscape and hence there are lot of places from where one can have a great view of the valley and greenery.
        
        There are no hotels or restaurants there at the view point. Have a few tea shops nearby. Both the upper deck and the lower deck has only stairs and wheel chairs cannot be manouvered.
        
        Kodanad View Point is around 18 Kms from Kotagiri. It is one of the smaller towns in the Nilgiri hills and is relatively unknown to outsiders. This beautiful place enjoys a climatic advantage over Ooty because it is protected by the Doddabetta mountain range from the onslaught of the south-west monsoon. Kodanad is one of the most scenic spots in the Nilgiris with scintillating 220 degree views, tall and dense pine forests, beautifully green tea estates and a pleasant nip in the air.
        
        Another special thing about Kodanad is that it is the home of AIADMK chief and chief minister of Tamil Nadu, Ms. Jayalalithaa. Most of the tea estates area falls under her property. Kodanad is Jayalalithaa’s summer home and relaxing centre`,

The 360-degree panoramic view from the summit is stunning. You can see the Bhavani river flowing into the Bhavani Sagar dam. There are no tourist facilities there except for a shelter if it rains. Take plenty of water and snacks if venturing up.

        The Rangasamy Tablet is a distinctive feature that is northwest of the Peak and often hides from view in the ever-present mist.
        
        To the less adventurous, both the Peak and Pillar are readily visible from the Kodanad View Point itself at a distance. Certainly a more comfortable option for older people.`,
